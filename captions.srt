00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:18,539
radiohead is no stranger to television

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:20,820
and film with their song showing up in a

4
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,320
variety of shows and movies you can most

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:29,400
likely name at least one memorable

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:31,920
occurrence but with a few exceptions

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,320
when a Radiohead song appears in a show

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:42,660
or a film you can guarantee that it is

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:44,520
therefore very significant reasons uses

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,030
of the Bands songs range from the very

Radiohead's music is rarely just a

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,100
stylistic flourish music basically is

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,229
like mathematics you know and you're

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,149
trying to form patterns patterns that

19
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:18,229
make you understand what is around you

20
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:19,250
and patterns that help you get through

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,710
when we hear a Radiohead song

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,020
accompanying a scene we are forced to

26
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,030
dig a little deeper take the opening

27
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:40,690
scene of incentives directed by Denis

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:42,460
Villeneuve the film takes place in the

29
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,040
Middle East but rather than traditional

30
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,680
Middle Eastern music we immediately get

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,050
a Radiohead song regarding this decision

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,610
Villeneuve stated the Radiohead song was

33
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,100
attached to the opening of the film from

34
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,870
day one one of the ideas behind the song

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,550
is for it to be clear that it will be a

36
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,340
Westerners point of view about this

37
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,590
world an imposters point of view that it

38
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,570
will be a fiction when you put the image

39
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,640
with an Arabic or Middle Eastern song it

40
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,429
looks authentic and I didn't like that

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,050
at all Radiohead is explicitly used as

42
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,750
an immediate tone Center for the film

43
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,720
the song creates a distance and forces

44
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:23,759
us into the perspective of an outsider

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,129
to really feel the impact of the

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,170
Radiohead song let's replace it with

48
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:37,599
some middle-eastern inspired music

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:37,599

50
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,070
we are no longer positioned where

51
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,590
Villeneuve has so thoughtfully placed us

52
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,690
we are enveloped in this world which in

53
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,640
this case creates for a more traditional

54
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,700
and less impactful viewing experience as

55
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,250
a band Radiohead is I guess what you

56
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,590
could refer to as cinematic in addition

57
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,150
to movie quality music videos two of

58
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,220
their key members are talented film

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,990
composers Thom Yorke kicked off his

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,180
scoring career with the Suspiria remake

61
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,530
and guitarist Jonny Greenwood has proven

62
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,070
himself to be one of the best in the

63
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,840
business

64
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,480
scoring films like there will be blood

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,490
the master phantom thread and you were

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,020
never really here but besides the

67
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,090
members having knowledge of cinematic

68
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,550
composing the band's unique sound

69
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,490
actually lends itself to cinema though

70
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,840
often classified as alternative rock

71
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,120
Radiohead's music transcends genres

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,880

[Music]

77
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,850
this song is rather electronic sounding

78
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,230
and actually suits this introductory

79
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,630
scene better than any original

80
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,460
composition could director Cameron Crowe

81
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,650
who surely knows great soundtracks

82
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,270
stated that this particular song is like

83
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,070
you've ripped open the human mind and

84
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,960
it's the thoughts and sounds of what

85
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,330
goes on in the psyche that's what we

86
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,290
want at Vanilla Sky to feel like

87
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,870
everything in its right place is a

88
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,150
rather uncomfortable piece of music it's

89
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,990
mechanical and unwelcoming and not very

90
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,390
catchy at all

91
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,280
additionally the lyrics reflect the

92
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,110
appearance based fastidiousness of Tom

93
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,270
Cruise's character this song

94
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,140
single-handedly introduces us to the

95
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:17,739
tone of this world

96
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:20,049
[Music]

97
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,940
we've looked at two examples of opening

98
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,410
a film with a Radiohead song so now

99
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,599
let's look at a film that closes with

100
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:29,680
one Denis Villeneuve followed up in

101
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:31,780
Sandy's with prisoners like in Sandy's

102
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,610
opened with a Radiohead song prisoners

103
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,160
ends with one and it's barely even

104
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,780
noticeable in a movie that relies so

105
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,150
heavily on traditional non-diegetic

106
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,740
scoring the introduction of a song with

107
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,900
lyrics is a little alarming and

108
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,639
evocative we realize that this song is

109
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,560
actually diegetic and is coming from the

110
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,599
workers boom box one of the workers

111
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,590
abruptly turns it off not allowing the

112
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:55,509
melody to resolve this minor detail may

113
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,979
seem insignificant but how does

114
00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:02,710
prisoners end it's ambiguous it feels

115
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:04,900
unfinished when we look at codex as an

116
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,599
actual song not what we hear in the film

117
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,450
the song itself never truly resolves

118
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:23,069
have a listen to the ending

119
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:23,069
[Music]

120
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:30,030
it feels like it should be continuing

121
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,440
but it doesn't much like prisoners when

122
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,420
we look at majority of the works that

123
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,380
use Radiohead music we have things like

124
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,900
Westworld Black Mirror The Prestige

125
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,520
children of men a Scanner Darkly

126
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,680
prisoners what do all these works have

127
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,140
in common they are all certainly

128
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,230
artfully crafted and rather unique but

129
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,340
more importantly they are cerebral

130
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,920
Radiohead's music tends to accompany

131
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,600
things that command us to think to get

132
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,910
more out of what's simply on the surface

133
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,070
the music basically is like mathematics

134
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,840
you know and you're trying to form

135
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,670
patterns for patterns that make you

136
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,630
understand what is around you and

137
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:14,610
patterns that help you get through the

138
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:16,680
next day Radiohead's music isn't just

139

drop to get the audience excited

141
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,420
Radiohead's music is a tool a tool for

142
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,910
filmmakers to communicate ideas that

143
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,089
they simply cannot
